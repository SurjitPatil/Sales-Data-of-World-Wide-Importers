# Summary – World Wide Importers Power BI Dashboard

This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard built using the World Wide Importers dataset from Kaggle. The data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query. The dashboard consists of two pages:

Summary Page: Highlights key metrics such as Total Revenue, Orders, and Active Customers. Includes sales trends by Fiscal Year, regional performance, and supports drill down (year → quarter → month) and drill through by Fiscal Year and Employee for deeper insights.

Product Details Page: Provides a breakdown of product-wise revenue, quantity sold, category and supplier performance. Interactive slicers enhance filtering, and drill through enables detailed views based on Fiscal Year and Employee.

The dashboard delivers clear insights into business and product performance, supporting data-driven decision-making.
